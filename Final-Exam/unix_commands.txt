# part (a)
# How would you print the file classlist.csv to the screen
# except the two header lines?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.
 
k=$2
filename = $3

k=$((k+2))
tail -n +$k $filename



# part (b)
# How would you construct a pipeline using the command from part (a)
# to determine how many distinct students are in this list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the number
# of students in the list.

tail -n +$k $filename | wc -1 *.csv

130 students in the list 


# part (c)

# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the names
# of the first and last students in the new list.

sort -d --firstname 

		 First Student at Top of list : Adam	Alcazar
		Bottom of the list : Zenia	Ziemba

# part (d)
# Construct a Unix pipeline involving these functions to determine
# how many students have the same first name. Which first names are
# repeated in the class list?
# Enter the relevant name(s) and the Unix command(s) below.

sort -d --firstname | grep -w 'First Name' classlist.csv



# part (f) [BONUS]
# Construct a Unix pipeline that extracts the last three digits of
